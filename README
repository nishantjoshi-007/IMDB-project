# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews

## Project Overview


This project involves performing sentiment analysis on the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset. The primary objective is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the content of the textual data. The project covers several key areas, including text preprocessing, classification using machine learning algorithms, and model evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The dataset is balanced, containing an equal number of positive and negative reviews.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Project Description**: Overview of the project objectives and goals.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, cleaning the text data by removing HTML tags, converting to lowercase, and removing punctuation.
3. **Text Vectorization**: Converting text data to numerical features using TF-IDF.
4. **Model Training**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and training a Naive Bayes classifier.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV for optimizing hyperparameters.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, Precision-Recall curve, and distribution of predicted probabilities.
7. **Visualization**: Visualizing the results using word clouds and distribution plots.
8. **Error Analysis**: Analyzing misclassified examples to understand model weaknesses.
9. **Conclusion**: Summarizing findings and suggesting potential future improvements.
